## Requirements
Requirements and dependencies to run the tool:
- [Python's latest version](https://www.python.org/)
- Base64 libraries
- Zlib libraries
- Binascii libraries
- Pyperclip libraries (clipboard)
- Codecs libraries
- Pyfiglet libraries

(Libraries can be installed with the command ```pip install your_lib_name```)

## How To Run The Tool
There's 2 ways to run the tool:
First off, download the source code, decompress it and then either:
- Install the libs manually then run the tool (main.py)
- Or run setup.bat (recommended) which will install the libs automatically for you (if you dont have them) and run the tool

## How To Use The Tool
The tool can be a bit tricky to use for the first time but you'll get used to it:
- Select an option (1-13 + The Exit option), press Enter, insert your encoded or decoded text, press Enter 2 times, obtain the output!
- Hexadecimal doesnt support spaces, so paste the encoded hexadecimal text WITHOUT spaces

## Is This Tool Safe?
Yes! This tool is meant for decoding and encoding, it doesnt not contain any malware form anywhere.
If you are skeptic, which is understandable, VirusTotal is always a good option!
